==========================================================================HOW PROJECT WORKS=================================================================================

The client sends a random challenge to the server, who the hashes and sends the signature back. If the signature and generated key do not match, an error is returned because the correct file was not sent. Else then the program continues.
The client and server verify the RSA pub and private matching, then the client calls for stenos.txt.
